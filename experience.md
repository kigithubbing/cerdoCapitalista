When writing the useFetch custom hook
I had a little of struggle on how to return something typed.
I have not yet go thorough the complete list of endpoint that the API has. I hope they are the same way which is

{
data : []
and more things here
}

#practice
I put in practice today the use of props in a component.

#Cors

I was not able to make it work locally the use of cors, and since I would need to make a similar work once the project is deployed, I will have the responses I need in different json files.
