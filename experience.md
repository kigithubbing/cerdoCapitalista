When writing the useFetch custom hook
I had a little of struggle on how to return something typed.
I have not yet go thorough the complete list of endpoint that the API has. I hope they are the same way which is

{
data : []
and more things here
}

#practice
I put in practice today the use of props in a component.

#Cors

I was not able to make it work locally the use of cors, and since I would need to make a similar work once the project is deployed, I will have the responses I need in different json files.

#Form
I learnt yesterday and today the use of react-hook-form
I am still not able how to make use of Invalid method when sending the form data, or in what ocassions it is useful
I need to be able to display good messages to the user, a good feedback so he knows what he is doing wrong.
Pattern on input validation is a great feature, even some say if you have a problem and try to resolve it with regular expressions, then you a another problem.

#Css
I suck on how to design a good html, excuse me for sucking hehe.
